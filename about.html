								<p>My home town is Fortaleza - Brazil, and my native language is Portuguese. I’ve always enjoyed puzzles and solving problems. When most people would feel demotivated and usually give up on a challenge, for some reason, I always felt even more motivated to get it solved or done. It’s like since I don’t like losing (I’m a bad loser!), I strive to get it figured out, no matter how long it takes. Because of that, I decided to study civil engineering (solving problems is what engineers do, most of the time!), and I started my undergrad engineering course at the age of 17.</p>
								<p>When I turned 19, I took a break from my course to serve a voluntary two-year religious mission in Santa Catarina, a Brazilian state located in the south of Brazil. It was something I wanted and had to do. Many people, especially the closest relatives, advised me not to do it, that it would impact my studies negatively. After two years away from books and classes, when I resumed my studies, my grades were even better than before. In those two years, I’ve learned things that I’ll carry with me for life.</p>
								<p>During my internships, while in school and after my graduation, I worked with drawing software, project management, and business analysis, in the construction field. That experience and the opportunity I had to see technology put into action, made me realize that more than only engineering, I wanted to dive deeper into the technology world and that learning is a passion I have. I decided then, to pursue higher education in a field that would allow me to apply my skills by working with technology in order to solve real-world problems. My wife and I, then, decided to go to the United States.</p>
								<p>As usual, I had people telling me that it would be really difficult. Some people even said that I wouldn’t make it since I had to study English from scratch. They, however, had no idea that telling me I wouldn’t make it only got me even more motivated to do it in the first place. Therefore, we ended up coming here. I studied English for four months and applied for the MSIS (Master of Science in Information Systems) course at the University of Utah from which I received, a couple of months later, an acceptance letter (and a scholarship, a few more months after). In the MSIS I found what I was looking for: the opportunity to work with data. That would require critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and it would allow me to use technology not only to solve real business problems but also to make the difference. It’s amazing when we turn a bunch of spreadsheets into graphs that actually tell a story, that drives people to make decisions that in the end will affect more than just ourselves or the people around us. That was what I was looking for, a chance to use my skills to cause impact.</p>
								<p>Life is a series of decisions we make every day, and I believe that growth has more to do with the experiences you had and what you learned from them then just celebrating a new year. One of the things I learned about myself is that I’m capable of overcoming any kind of challenges I may face, no matter what others say. Now I’m currently working with Data Analysis in Salt Lake City, and if you think I may not be suitable for the kind of work you have in mind, just give me a try. </p>
