									<h1>Adventure Works Report Project<br /></h1>
									<p>This is a visualization report created in Power BI where the dataset from a ficticious company, Adventure Works, is analysed.<br />
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/adventures/powerbi.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Some of the report's features are described below:</p>
								<p style="font-size:17px">1. Interactive dashboard, with capability of filtering and highlighting multiple graphs when one is selected</p>
								<p style="font-size:17px">2. Dataset was cleaned and prepared upfront</p>
								<p style="font-size:17px">3. Relationships between tables were created in a SQL format</p>
								<p style="font-size:17px">4. DAX measures were applied to create additional columns in different tables</p>
								<p style="font-size:17px">5. Page filters, visual filters, and report level filters were used</p>
								<p style="font-size:17px">6. Drillthrough functionality applied</p>
								<p style="font-size:17px">7. Bookmarks were used to filter data given a specific situation</p>
								<p>The following images describe the dashboards that were created. The first one is an executive summary that gives a general idea of: the products by category and subcategory, the products' demand by region, some quick numbers for the monthly revenue, monthly orders, and monthly returns, and the top product for orders and profit. The orders can also be displayed in a certain range, by using a date filter.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/adventures/execsummary.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The next image describes the product's dashboard, that can be accessed by clicking on the View Product Detail button, after selecting a specific product from the product's list, in the Executive Summary. This dashboard shows the details for the chosen product: the weekly profit, the comparison between the monthly current order for that product against the target goal (and the same thing for revenue goal), and the weekly return volume for that product. The price adjustment field allows you to make estimatives by changing the product's price in percentage.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/adventures/product.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The third one depicts the customer's dashboard. In this dashboard we can see a list of all customers and have a glimpse of the orders by gender, by income level, by age, and by occupation. At the top of the dashboard we can see the top customer (the one provided the most revenue), his total number of orders, and the total revenue produced. At the bottom, we can see a graph that shows the orders and revenue by month.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/adventures/customer.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The following picture displays the relationship among tables in a SQL format, where we have primary keys to uniquely identify each table and the foreign keys to join the tables together.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/adventures/sql.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The following images will show the DAX measure formulas used to create additional columns and calculated fields that were used in the dashboards.</p>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/adventures/tables1.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/adventures/tables2.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/adventures/tables3.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/adventures/tables4.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/adventures/tables5.PNG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>If you want to interact with the dashboard, please refer to the link below and download the file. Note that you will need to have the Power BI Desktop instaled, in order to open the file, or access to the Power BI Services (the web version).</p>
